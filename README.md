#Blogging Platform
Model Classes:
User: Represents a user of the blogging platform. It includes fields such as id, username, and password.
BlogPost: Represents a blog post with fields like id, title, content, and author (which references the User who wrote the post).
Comment: Represents a comment made by a user on a specific blog post. It contains fields like id, content, author (referencing the user who wrote the comment), and blogPost (referencing the blog post on which the comment was made).

Repository Interfaces:

UserRepository: Provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the User entity, including methods like findByUsername to find a user by their username.
BlogPostRepository: Provides CRUD operations for the BlogPost entity.
CommentRepository: Provides CRUD operations for the Comment entity.

Controllers:

UserController: Handles API requests related to user management. It includes endpoints for user registration (/api/users/register) where a new user can be registered with a unique username and password.
BlogPostController: Manages API requests for blog post management. It includes endpoints like fetching all blog posts (/api/blog-posts) and creating a new blog post (/api/blog-posts) with the authenticated user as the author.
CommentController: Handles API requests related to comments on blog posts. It includes an endpoint for creating a new comment (/api/comments) on a specific blog post identified by its postId, along with the authenticated user as the author.
The code follows the RESTful API design principles, where each resource (user, blog post, comment) is represented by a separate controller, and different HTTP methods (GET, POST) are used to perform various operations on these resources.

Additionally, the code demonstrates the use of Spring Security for user authentication and authorization. The BCryptPasswordEncoder is used to securely store and verify user passwords.
